	<p>Methodsave is the first bookmark manager with a methodillion downloads.</p>
	<h2>The new standard for Linux</h2>
	<p>
		Enjoy full integration with the GNOME desktop: Take a screenshot, and
		Methodsave will save everything inside it. Use desktop search to find your
		bookmarks. With <a href="/tangent">Tangent</a>, see Methodsave buttons all
		over the Web.

	<h2>The new standard for Android</h2>

			>inside your apps</strong
